I'm reading Programming The Collective Intelligence and all of the book's examples are in Python, so I have to port a lot of stuff.  

This library is one of those ports and was extracted from my experimentations on building recommendation systems for delicious links/tags.

Have fun and feel free to copy, modify and distribute.
